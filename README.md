# Algorithms-and-Visualizations

## Course Description

In this course, we will explore how algorithmic and aesthetic principles can be employed in concert to create interactive graphical content on the web. Topics will include design layout and combinatorial optimization, the geometry of color spaces, graph drawing, computational geometry, generative design, and visualization of data and algorithms. In addition, we will consider issues of algorithmic efficiency in performing computationally intensive tasks. We will investigate topics from both theoretical and applied perspectives. Students will code projects using standard web development tools: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Course Goals

### The main goals of this course are:
To develop technical proficiency with standard web programming tools.
To learn to apply algorithmic techniques in order to (1) solve geometric problems, and (2) achieve desired aesthetic ends.
To generate visualizations of data and algorithmic processes
