### What it does

The applyRule(config, Rule) function allows you to pass in any update rule following the naming conventions for cellular automata. Given an initial configuration in the form of an array, it will return a new array containing the updated states based on the rule it was given 

### Easily change inputs

#### Additional Note

The setConfig(length, array) function allows you to easily create an initial configuration by specifying the length of the array with the 'length" argument and the cell numbers that you want to have "on". 
Example: [0,24,7,3] says set the cells at index 0,24 and 7 to be "on"
